# Grab_CV_Challenge
This repository holds the files and the descriptions of the Grab's Computer vision challenge of recognizing the car make, model and colour. I am a beginner in this field and this repository contains the feature extraction and the training of the dataset. I am still in the process of fine-tuning the training and start with the validation and testing.
